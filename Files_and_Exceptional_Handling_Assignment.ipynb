        "**Theory Questions**\n",
        "\n",
        "###Q.1: What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "\n",
        "Interpreted languages execute code line by line without compiling it into machine code, allowing easier debugging and platform independence.\n",
        "\n",
        "Compiled languages translate the entire program into machine code before execution, generally resulting in faster performance but less flexibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Q.2: What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "\n",
        "Exception handling in Python is a mechanism to catch and handle runtime errors, preventing the program from crashing and enabling graceful error recovery using try, except, else, and finally blocks.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Q.3: What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "\n",
        "The finally block contains code that is executed regardless of whether an exception occurred or not, often used for cleanup actions like closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Q.4: What is logging in Python?\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "\n",
        "Logging is the process of recording messages from a Python program to various outputs (console, files) to track events, errors, and informational messages during execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Q.5: What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "\n",
        "The __del__ method is a destructor that is called when an object is about to be destroyed. It is useful for cleaning up resources such as closing files or network connections.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Q.6: What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "\n",
        "import module imports the whole module and requires usage of the module name to access its functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "from module import name imports a specific attribute or function directly, allowing usage without module prefix.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Q.7: How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiple exceptions can be handled by specifying them as a tuple in a single except block or by using multiple except blocks for different exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Q.8: What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "\n",
        "The with statement ensures proper acquisition and release of resources, automatically closing the file after its block is executed, even if exceptions occur.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Q.9: What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "\n",
        "Multithreading uses multiple threads within a single process sharing the same memory space, suited for I/O-bound tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiprocessing uses multiple processes with separate memory spaces, suited for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Q.10: What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "\n",
        "Logging helps track events, debug errors, monitor program execution, and record history for audits or troubleshooting without interrupting the program flow.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Q.11: What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "\n",
        "Memory management refers to the allocation and deallocation of memory during the lifetime of a program to optimize resource use and avoid memory leaks.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Q.12: What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "\n",
        "The basic steps are: try to execute code, catch exceptions with except, optionally use else for code when no exception occurs, and finally for cleanup actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Q.13: Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "\n",
        "Proper memory management ensures efficient use of resources, prevents memory leaks, and maintains program performance over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Q.14: What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "\n",
        "The try block contains code that might throw an exception; the except block catches and handles the exception to prevent the program from crashing.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Q.15: How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "\n",
        "Pythonâ€™s garbage collector frees memory by detecting and removing objects that are no longer referenced, using reference counting and cyclic garbage collection.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Q.16: What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "\n",
        "The else block executes code only if the try block does not raise an exception, allowing separation of normal code from exception handling code.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Q.17: What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "\n",
        "The common levels are DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL, representing different severities of log messages.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Q.18: What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "\n",
        "os.fork() creates a new process by duplicating the current one but is Unix-specific; multiprocessing is a cross-platform Python module for creating and managing processes with more features.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Q.19: What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "\n",
        "Closing a file ensures that all buffered data is written to disk and releases system resources tied to the file.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Q.20: What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "\n",
        "file.read() reads the entire contents of the file.\n",
        "\n",
        "file.readline() reads one line at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Q.21: What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "\n",
        "The logging module provides a flexible framework for emitting log messages from Python programs to various outputs and supports different severity levels.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Q.22: What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "\n",
        "The os module provides a way to interact with the operating system, enabling operations like file creation, deletion, renaming, checking existence, and directory manipulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Q.23: What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "\n",
        "Challenges include managing reference cycles, controlling fragmented memory, and avoiding memory leaks especially when using extensions or large data.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Q.24: How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using the raise keyword followed by an exception type or instance, for example, raise ValueError(\"Invalid input\").\n",
        "\n",
        "###Q.25: Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "\n",
        "Multithreading allows concurrent execution of tasks, improving performance in I/O-bound or high-latency operations like web servers or user interfaces.\n",
